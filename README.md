**Classification of Influenza viruses based on surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) using sequence comparison alignment and free-alignment methods.**

Influenza viruses are classified based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). These proteins determine the subtype of the virus, with 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N11) identified so far. This classification helps in understanding the virus' behavior and in developing targeted vaccines.
This project aims to compare the effectiveness of alignment and free-alignment approaches for sequences comparison.
